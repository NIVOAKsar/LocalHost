# Local Host

This is the final project of the coding bootcamp made by us.  
LocalHost is an app that helps you find the right place to stay on your trip around the world.  
Really simple to use - you can be guest or host, and share information about your own place,  
giving you a unique opportunity to meet new people, and overall improves your travelling exprience.  
The concept is totally free, simillar to the famous website https://www.couchsurfing.com/
