# Local Host

This is our final project for the Coding-Academy made with Vue.js & Vuex.    
LocalHost is an app that helps you find the right place to stay on your travels around the world.      
Really simple to use - you can be a guest or a host, share information about your own location and more.   
Provides you with a unique opportunity to meet new people, and overall improves your travel experience.
